## Intro To Computing
Project for CSC 103 - Intro To Computing with Professor William Skeith at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
In this project, you are going to implement [Conway’s Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). There are quite some interesting things to say about the Game of Life, but for our purposes, we just care that it makes pretty pictures.

What you’ll learn from doing this:
- More about the `<vector>` class.
- Reading and writing files.
- Command line arguments and getopt_long.
- Functions and arguments.
- A bit more about the unix shell.
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
## Ask me about anything
